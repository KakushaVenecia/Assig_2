            <p> My name is <b>Venecia Kakusha</b> </p>
             <p>Technology is in every little thing we do nowadays. I have grown to love it as it has intergrated with normal
            day to day activities. The reason I like coding is because I get to see progressive growth, and to see the
            final result of my work is rewarding. I love
            technology, because it <em> provides tangible solutions </em> to everyday life. </p>

        <p>CSS controls the fonts, text, colors, backgrounds, margins, and layout. It gives a website its <em> look and
                layout </em>.</p>
        <p>
            CSS enables us to:
            <ul>
                <li> <b> Specify fonts </b> other than the default for the browser</li>
                <li> <b> Specify color and size </b> of text and links</li>
                <li> <b> Apply colors to backgrounds </b> </li>
                <li>Contain webpage elements in boxes and <b> float </b> those boxes to specific
                    positions
                    on the page</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p> In CSS, a <b>margin </b> is the <em>space around an element's border,</em> while <b>padding </b> is the
            <em>space between
                an
                element's
                border and
                the element's content </em>. Put another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element,
            and the
            padding
            property controls the space inside an element. <b>Border </b> is the strip that goes <em>around your
                div/element of the
                content</em>. In general, use margins when you're adjusting the spacing of an
            element in relation to another element (i.e a div in relation to another div on the page), and padding when
            you're
            adjusting the look of an individual element (i.e the amount of pixels between the edge of a div and the text
            within
            it).</p>
